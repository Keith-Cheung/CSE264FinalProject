# CSE264FinalProject
Implementing a game as a web app for the final project in CSE264. We decided to create a game similar to doodle jump where the the game mechanics include moving left and right, jumping up and down on platforms and avoiding obstacles. Scores increase every time the frog jumps on a new platform. The game ends when the frog collides with the obstacle or the frog drops to the bottom of the screen. 

This app was created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS
